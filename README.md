# brief intro
In this (ring-road multi-lane) traffic simulation, one can take the wheel of a car for changing lanes, acceleration and deceleration in real time. Also, one can observe the traffic dynamics and stop-and-go waves through plotting the time-space diagram of trajectories.

# how to use
1. Matlab is needed
2. Change settings in "Z_Config.m"
3. Type "Main_A_Simulation" in Command Window to run the simulation and interactive interface.
   3.1 Press 'Enter' on the keyboard to enter the interactive mode; Press it again to quit.
   3.2 'Up' - accelerate
   3.3 'Down' - decelerate
   3.4 'Left' - Change lane to left
   3.5 'Right' - Change lane to right
5. Type "Main_B_PlotTrajectory" in Command Window to plot the trajectories
6. Type "Main_C_ReplayAnimation" in Command Window to replay an animation for the simulation process
7. Simulation results (data) are saved in the folder "SimulationResult"

# still working on convincing myself to release all the code
Any suggestions are welcome!
